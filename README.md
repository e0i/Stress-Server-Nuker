# Stress Server Nuker
Firstly, ensure that you are running Python 3.10.0, to check your Python version open command prompt and run the command ```python --version```. 

After verifying that you have Python 3.10.0 installed please make sure you have all the neccessary packages, you can find the neccessary packages in the ```requirements.txt``` file. To download all packages simultaneously open command prompt and run the following command: ```pip install -r requirements.txt```

Keep in mind that Stress wasn't made to contend with any major server nukers. I made it after a few people kept suggesting it, overall it performs decently, but no exceptional performance.

No EXE this time, if for some odd you reason want to use part of this in your own nuker then just **credit me.**

Also, this was kinda poorly made, sooo once again don't expect any elite performance.
